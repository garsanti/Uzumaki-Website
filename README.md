# Uzumaki-Website
Middleman website for connection between users and the hospital, to view their records and set up appointments.


Project was made by 3 people only, unfortunately we don't pay for this website anymore as it was accruing money from us, but there is a PowerPoint which explains what it does, as well as a video showing when it was up and running which some of the functionalities can be seen.
